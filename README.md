# Analyzing-The-Diamond-Price-Based-on-different-factors-using-Linear-Regression
The model predicts the price of the diamonds. Used linear regression and did several T-test to
conclude which factor affecting the price of the diamonds the most.
## Objective 
<p>The objective of our project is to analyze and model the price of the diamond based on carat, colour,
clarity and certification.</p>
